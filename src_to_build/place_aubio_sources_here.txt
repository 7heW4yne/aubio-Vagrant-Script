Just download the sources of the aubio version you want to cross-compile and
place it in this folder.
After that the waf and wscript file of the aubio root folder should be in this
folder and you can run Vagrant to build aubio.

Possible downloads:
-> latest version: https://github.com/aubio/aubio
-> older releases: https://aubio.org/pub/

ATTENTION:
You need aubio version 0.4.4 or higher, because this was the first released
version with the build_mingw script.
